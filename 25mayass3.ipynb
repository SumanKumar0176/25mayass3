    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
    "i.Modularity and Reusability:Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, self-contained modules. \n",
    "ii.Code Organization:Functions help in organizing code by grouping related tasks together.\n",
    "iii.Abstraction: Functions provide an abstraction layer that allows you to hide complex implementation details.\n",
    "iv.Code Reusability and DRY Principle: Functions promote the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle.\n",
    "v.Readability and Maintainability: Functions improve the readability of code by providing meaningful names to encapsulate specific operations or tasks. \n",
    "vi.Testing and Debugging: Functions enable easier testing and debugging.\n",
    "vii.Scalability and Collaboration: Functions facilitate collaboration among developers working on the same project."

    "Ans:\n",
    "The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.\n",

    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The difference between a function and a function call can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "i.Definition vs. Invocation: A function is a block of code that is defined or created with a specific name, parameters (if any), and a set of instructions\n",
    " to be executed when the function is called. On the other hand, a function call is the act of actually executing or invoking the function, causing\n",
    " the instructions inside the function to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii.Structure and Purpose: A function represents a reusable and modular piece of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It is defined \n",
    "to encapsulate functionality and can be used multiple times within a program. A function call, on the other hand, is the point in the program where \n",
    "the function is called, triggering the execution of the code inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.Syntax: In most programming languages, including Python, a function is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameter\n",
    " list (if any), and a colon. The function call, however, is simply the function name followed by parentheses, possibly containing the arguments or \n",
    "parameters to be passed to the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.Action and Result: When a function is called, the code inside the function is executed, performing the specified operations or tasks. \n",
    "The function may also return a value or produce a desired effect. A function call, on the other hand, initiates the execution of the function, \n",
    "passing any required arguments and potentially receiving a return value or effect from the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "v.\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\")  # Function call\n",

    " Variables defined in the global scope are accessible throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Scopes: The number of local scopes in a Python program depends on the number of function definitions. Each function creates its own local scope,\n",

    "\n",
    "ii.Scope Destruction: When the function call returns, the local scope of the function is destroyed. This includes any variables defined within that scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii.Memory Release: The memory allocated for the variables in the local scope is released, freeing up resources. This memory is \n",
    "now available for other parts of the program to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv.Variable Inaccessibility: Any attempt to access a variable that was defined within the local scope after the function call has returned will \n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a return value refers to the value that a function can send back to the caller or the code that invoked the function. \n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "To make a function variable refer to the global variable in Python, you can use the global keyword within the function. \n",
    "By declaring a variable as global, you inform Python that the variable being used in the function should be the same as\n",
